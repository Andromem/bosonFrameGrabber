## Project Timeline:
* Large sized demo board designed/ordered/assembled (SAMD51/ICE5UP)
* Insparation for a smaller form-factor using Lattice ice40HX8K (softcore)
* Routing done with 4 layer PCB. Ordered prototypes from OshPark (error in footprint)
* PCB panel ordered from JLC.
* Starting work on Verilog simulation for RAM + Camera.
